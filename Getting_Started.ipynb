    "In this notebook, we will become familiar with the GRASS working environment and toolsets. After setting up a new GRASS project and importing data, we'll look at an example case study in a small watershed in Eastern North Carolina. Part of the Cape Fear Watershed, Stocking Head Creek flows through a heavily agricultural area and has some of the highest densities of swine farms in the country. We'll compute where the swine waste would flow in the case of a storage lagoon leak and how much the creek would need to flood in order to innundate the lagoon and introduce the waste matter to the environment.\n",
